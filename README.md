# Tkinter-GUI

A Graphical User Interface displaying the power of Event-Driven programming.

This GUI application, using the tkinter built-in module, displays a single Python Zen button. 
When the button is clicked, the application will open a new window containing the Zen of Python text that was imported from the this module. 
The this module is a Python easter egg. 
After import, it prints on standard output the 19 aphorisms that are the guiding principles of Python's design.

The GUI coding principals are fundamental in helping us understand Synchronous and Asynchronous programming.
