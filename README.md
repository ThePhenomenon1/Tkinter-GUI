# Tkinter-GUI

Here we have a Graphical User Interface displaying the power of Event-Driven programming. Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages passing from other programs or threads. 

The difference between the event-driven and procedure-driven models is primarily one of program flow. In a typical procedure-driven program, the execution of program statements is predetermined and controlled by the programmer. It generally runs from the beginning of the source file to the end.

This GUI application, created using the tkinter built-in module, displays a single Python Zen button. 
When the button is clicked, the application will open a new window containing the Zen of Python text that was imported from the 'this' module. 
The 'this' module is a Python easter egg. 
After import, it prints on standard output the 19 aphorisms that are the guiding principles of Python's design.

My favourite aphorism is:
"Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"

Good to have mastered that namespace concept!

The GUI coding principals are fundamental in helping us understand Synchronous and Asynchronous programming.
