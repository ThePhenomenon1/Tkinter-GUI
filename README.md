# Tkinter-GUI

Here we have a Graphical User Interface displaying the power of Event-Driven programming.

This GUI application, created using the tkinter built-in module, displays a single Python Zen button. 
When the button is clicked, the application will open a new window containing the Zen of Python text that was imported from the 'this' module. 
The 'this' module is a Python easter egg. 
After import, it prints on standard output the 19 aphorisms that are the guiding principles of Python's design.

My favourite aphorism is:
"Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"

The GUI coding principals are fundamental in helping us understand Synchronous and Asynchronous programming.
